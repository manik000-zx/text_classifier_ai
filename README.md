# Text Classifier AI 

A Python-based AI project developed by **Manik** to classify text into different categories using a machine learning model.

This project allows users to input any text and get an instant prediction of the category or type of the text. It is designed to be **fast, accurate, and interactive** through a web interface built with Streamlit.

---

## How It Works

1. User enters a piece of text in the input box.  
2. The AI model processes the text using natural language processing techniques.  
3. The model predicts the category of the text based on its training data.  
4. The result is displayed instantly on the web interface.

This project uses **Python** for the backend, **Streamlit** for the web app interface, and **scikit-learn** (or any ML library you used) for the text classification model.
